# IST Feed Adder
Browser extension that adds new RSS sources to IST's Fénix news feed.

The goal of this project is to enhance Fénix's news feed, allowing users to add RSS feeds from curricular units inside or outside the Fénix system. This is particularly useful for mobility students, who would be able to integrate news and announcements from their curricular units into Fénix.
