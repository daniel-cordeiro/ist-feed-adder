# IST Feed Adder
Browser extension that adds new RSS sources to IST's Fénix news feed.

The goal of this project is to enhance Fénix's news feed, allowing users to add RSS feeds from curricular units outside the Fénix system. This is particularly useful for mobility students, who would be able to integrate news and announcements from their curricular units into Fénix.

**Currently only works in Firefox with the curricular unit [Cálculo II - TP](https://cdi2tp.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) hardcoded in.** This demo is the starting point of this project, built in order to learn about [browser extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) and remote RSS fetching and parsing (as well as some JavaScript).
